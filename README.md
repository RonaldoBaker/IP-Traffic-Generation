# IP-Traffic-Generation

With the need to accommodate more Internet users each year, it is important that we are able to appropriately plan and optimise Internet networks. To do this, we must be able to simulate Internet Protocol (IP) traffic in different scenarios to evaluate the capacity requirements of growing demands. 

As part of a 3rd year Electronic & Electrical Engineering project at University College London, it was found that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are becoming a common method of generating synthetic internet traffic.

## Generation of synthetic IP traffic
The GAN model in a Jupyter Notebook can be reviewed in the repository. The training data used comes from a public dataset on Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsrojas/ip-network-traffic-flows-labeled-with-87-apps/data]. 

## GAN Optimisation
With a number of hyperparameters in the GAN model, it is important to optimise these hyperparameters to produce synthetic data that replicates the training data
